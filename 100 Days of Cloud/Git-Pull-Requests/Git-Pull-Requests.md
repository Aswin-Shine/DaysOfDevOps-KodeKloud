Max want to push some new changes to one of the repositories but we don't want people to push directly to master branch, since that would be the final version of the code. It should always only have content that has been reviewed and approved. We cannot just allow everyone to directly push to the master branch. So, let's do it the right way as discussed below:

SSH into storage server using user max, password Max_pass123 . There you can find an already cloned repo under Max user's home.

Max has written his story about The 🦊 Fox and Grapes 🍇

Max has already pushed his story to remote git repository hosted on Gitea branch story/fox-and-grapes

Check the contents of the cloned repository. Confirm that you can see Sarah's story and history of commits by running git log and validate author info, commit message etc.

Max has pushed his story, but his story is still not in the master branch. Let's create a Pull Request(PR) to merge Max's story/fox-and-grapes branch into the master branch

Solution: 

```
ssh max@ststor01
cd story-blogs
git status
git log --oneline

```
