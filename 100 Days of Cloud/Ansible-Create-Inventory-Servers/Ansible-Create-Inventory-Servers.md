The Nautilus DevOps team is testing Ansible playbooks on various servers within their stack. They've placed some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/ directory on the jump host and now intend to test them on app server 3 in Stratos DC. However, an inventory file needs creation for Ansible to connect to the respective app. Here are the requirements:

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.

b. Include App Server 3 in this inventory along with necessary variables for proper functionality.

c. Ensure the inventory hostname corresponds to the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.

Solution :

1. Get in the folder on jumphost & create inventory file.

```
cd /home/thor/playbook
ls
vi inventory

stapp03 ansible_host=stapp03 ansible_user=banner ansible_password='BigGr33n'

cat inventory

```

2. Check the playbook is working or not.

```
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
```
